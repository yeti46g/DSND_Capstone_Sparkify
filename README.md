### 1. Project Summary

This project focuses on practicing manipulating large datasets with Spark through PySpark to engineer features and build machine learning models. It also provides an opportunity (and a large dataset -- 12G) to get familiar with cloud computing platform such as Amazon AWS. These above mentioned skills are applied to analyze and predict customer churn for a fictitious music streaming company, Sparkify. 

Please note that this project's emphasis is on learning spark. The ML model created here is a baseline model without in-depth tunning. The resulting model is not intented for high accuracy classification, but for demonstrating the end-to-end process.

### 2. Installation
In addition to the regular data science libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib, the following software/libraries need to be installed to run the codes in this repo.

	1. Spark
	2. PySpark


### 3. Acknowledgement

This project is part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree content. The dataset is provided by Udacity.
